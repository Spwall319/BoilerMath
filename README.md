Once all of those are installed to run the program put your OpenAI API Access Code into the spot in OpenAI.py
Then put your equation image in the given spot in main.py

<h1>Tips for Better Accuracy:</h1>

-Try to even split the numbers and symbol apart with the symbol in the dead center.
This leads to better splicing of the image.
