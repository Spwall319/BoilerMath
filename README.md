#Once all of those are installed to run the program put your OpenAI API Access Code into the spot in OpenAI.py
#Then put your equation image in the given spot in main.py

#Bigger Numbers and Symbols are better
#Try to even split the numbers and symbol apart with the symbol in the dead center.
#This leads to better splicing of the image.
